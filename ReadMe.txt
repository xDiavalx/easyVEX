You don't have to mention me when you use this stuff, but I appreciate it if you do. Please send me a message (email dimitri.shima.dev@gmail.com) if you mention me somewhere, so I can find out about it.


Please contribute to this project! 
Tell me what I am doing wrong.
Tell me how I can improve performance. 
Add and suggest new functions. 
I want to learn from you!

How to use:
Put the files into 
$HFS/houdini/vex/include/ 
path, or into something like 
C:\Users\[USER]\Documents\houdini[VERSION]\vex\include (for Windows).

So under Windows best put the easyVex.h file into
C:\Users\[USER]\Documents\houdini[VERSION]\vex\include 

When you write VEX code and want to use easyVex functions type: 
#include "easyVex.h"
Then you can just use stuff defined in the easyVex.h file.

Note: If your filepath is soemthing like: 
C:\Users\[USER]\Documents\houdini[VERSION]\vex\include\easyVex\easyVex.h
You will need to use
#include "easyVex/easyVex.h"

There is an automatically generated documentation!
Open:
\easyVexDocs\html\index.html
in a browser of choice.

Then go to Files/File List/easyVex.h and you will get a full overview of all functions, structs and the sturct's functions!

Enjoy! XD
